\description{
This dataset contains a matrix and a data frame: genus-level microbiome profiles and
corresponding sample metadata from an oral microbiome perturbation study.
28 participants' oral microbiomes were measured before, 15 minutes after, and 2 hours
after perturbation with either a water control, antiseptic mouthwash, alchohol-free mouthwash,
or soda. The dataset is used in examples and vignettes throughout the package.
}
\details{
The \code{counts} matrix has one row per sample and one column per genus.
The \code{metadata} data frame has one row per sample with metadata, critically the participant ID, flow cytometry average (and replicate) cells, time_c (time points), and treat (the perturbations )
