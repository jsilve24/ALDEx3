Description: Provides scalable generalized linear and mixed effects models tailored for sequence count data analysis (e.g., analysis of 16S or RNA-seq data).  
    Uses Dirichlet-multinomial sampling to quantify uncertainty in relative abundance or relative expression conditioned on observed count data. 
    Implements scale models as a generalization of normalizations which account for uncertainty in scale (e.g., total abundances).
